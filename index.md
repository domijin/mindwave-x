## Our Business
We make a device that transcribes conversations into time-stamped and speaker-annotated notes with summaries.

### Vision
At MindWave, we seek to build an approach to understand the most intuitive and direct reflection of human intelligence, speech and conversations.

By providing Hardware as a Service, we will act as the upstream of human-internet interface that not only enhance your communication skills but also provide unprecedented add-on values to access, interact and understand information.

From augmented intelligence, to artificial intelligence, MindWave will transform the world to rethink about data, device and intelligence.

### Problem
- Information Overload
    - Audios are easy to record but hard to review 
    - Taking notes is distractive
- Fear of A.I. Overlord
    - Human should be first
    - Human is still more intelligent
    - A.I. should enhance human intelligence
